CAUTION: Your details are saved in plaintext. Anyone can open the file and read them.

When the program starts, a python command line window will open. DO NOT CLOSE THIS, else the program will end as well.

To start this program, just double click 'Ashoka Autologin.py'. If you've already entered your username etc, you don't have to enter them again.

Instructions for use:

1. Launch 'Ashoka Autologin.py'
2. Fill in your username and password.
3. Fill in how many hours you want between log-ins (the server logs you out every 12 hours, recommend setting time as 11)
4. Chill

In case your login details change:

1. Open Autologin_data.txt
2. Line 1 has your username
   Line 2 has your password
   Line 3 has your log-in delay
3. Change whatever you need to, and save the file.
